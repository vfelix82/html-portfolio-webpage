                <p>I was born in the <strong>Philippines</strong>. I came to America wee bit lad of
                  7 years old. Came directly to Seattle and lived here ever since!</p>
                  
                <p>I am a noob when it comes to coding but at the end of this course
                I will be a Master League! I worked for Virginia Mason Hospital for 10 years
                as a hospital coordinator. I made sure the flow of the hospital goes
                smoothly by coordinating with nurses, engineering, and housekeepers things
                they needed. I love the job because of family oriented team we had, but sadly
                I had leave. My sister has cerebral polosi. She is very smart but her motor
                functions do not function properly. My mother was the prime caretaker
                but needed my help so I decided to leave and become the prime caretaker.</p>
            
                <p>I decided to go back to school when things settled back at home. We had more
                help for my sister so I decided to further my education. How I learned about
                coding and Epicudos was from a gaming friend that I met during my WoW years.
                He completed the course in <em>Oregon</em> and raved how great it was, and how he got
                a great job right after graduation. And now i'm here, and enjoying my new
                experience!</p>

                <p>Traveling and gaming is my life. I love to meet new people and kill
                noobs in any competitive games. My 2 main destition I love
                travel to are Hawaii and the Philippines. Anywhere that is paradise on earth
                is where I want to travel. I have no idea why I am in Seattle because this
                weather is depressing!</p>
