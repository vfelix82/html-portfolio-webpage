        7 years old. Came directly to Seattle and lived here ever since!

    <h3>About myself</h3>
      <p>I am a noob when it comes to coding but at the end of this course
        I will be a Master League! Traveling and gaming is my life. I love to meet
      new people and kill noobs in any competitive games. My 2 main destition I love
      travel to are Hawaii and the Philippines. Anywhere that is paradise on this earth
      is where I want to travel. I have no idea why I am in Seattle because this
      weather is depressing!</p>
