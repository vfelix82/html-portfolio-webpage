    <h3>My History</h3>
      <p>I was born in the great Philippines. I came to America wee bit lad of
        7 years old. Came directly to Seattle and lived here ever since!

    <h3>My background</h3>
      <p>I am a noob when it comes to coding but at the end of this course
        I will be a Master League! I worked for Virginia Mason Hospital for 10 years
        as a hospital coordinator. I made sure the flow of the hospital goes
        smoothly by coordinating with nurses, engineering, and housekeepers things
        they needed. I love the job because of family oriented team we had, but sadly
        I had leave. My sister has cerebral polosi. She is very smart but her motor
        functions do not function properly. My mother was the prime caretaker
        but needed my help so I decided to leave and become the prime caretaker.</p>

      <p>I decided to go back to school when things settled back at home. We had more
        help for my sister so I decided to further my education. How I learned about
        coding and Epicudos was from a gaming friend that I met during my WoW years.
        He completed the course in Oregon and raved how great it was, and how he got
        a great job right after graduation. And now i'm here and enjoying my new
        experience!</p>


    <h3>About myself</h3>
      <p> Traveling and gaming is my life. I love to meet new people and kill
      noobs in any competitive games. My 2 main destition I love
      travel to are Hawaii and the Philippines. Anywhere that is paradise on earth
      is where I want to travel. I have no idea why I am in Seattle because this
      weather is depressing!</p>
